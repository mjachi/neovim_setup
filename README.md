# My neovim setup

## Setup...
- Note that `zbirenbaum/copilot.lua` depends on files generated by the official
  `copilot.vim` plugin. e.g. Install that, run through `:Copilot` setup, and
  ensure that `~/.config/github-copilot` is non-empty; then, uninstall `copilot.vim`
  and proceed with `zbirenbaum/copilot.lua` and `zbirenbaum/copilot-cmp`, which is
  mostly done already.

## TODO's

- LaTeX
  - Would like to be able to have a fully featured plugin, but nothing
  will fit in well with current setup... use ftplugin for this?



## Suggestions
- Could possibly map some key pairing to a language particular "special command"?
  - Julia would be to insert the respective unicode characters. LaTeX would be to
  open PDF in zathura... C/C++ could be to switch between current file and respective
  header.
