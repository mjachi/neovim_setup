TODO's

- Julia elicits some strange interactions
  - Coloring should now be fine now that there is no conflict between
  the actual julials and the additional module
  - Since the module has now been removed, there is no unicode from LaTeX
  completion
  - Use ftplugins?


- LaTeX
  - Would like to be able to have a fully featured plugin, but nothing
  will fit in well with current setup... use ftplugin for this?



Suggestions
- Could possibly map some key pairing to a language particular "special command"?
  - Julia would be to insert the respective unicode characters. LaTeX would be to
  open PDF in zathura... C/C++ could be to switch between current file and respective
  header.
